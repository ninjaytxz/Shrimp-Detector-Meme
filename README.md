(I am not sure if this is the original creator but I got the video from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/doodoofard/comments/1ggr1gg/shrimp_detector/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button))


It was recreated using Python and Pygame (to play the sound)

## How to download:
1) Click the the green **Download Code** button
2) Extract the files using [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0)

You can see the code for yourself in the main.py file and modify it <3
